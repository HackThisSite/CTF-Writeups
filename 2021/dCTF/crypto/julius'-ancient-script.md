Objective: Decode the given text and find the flag
<br>

Process to find the flag: So the text that was given to us was this: rq7t{7vH_rFH_vI6_pHH1_qI67}.
<br>
I tried a few decoders such as cyberchef, cryptii and some unpopular sites as well but none of them seemed to work.
<br>Then after going through more random unpopular sites I found one site which gave me good result https://planetcalc.com/8572/.
<br>I entered the encrypted flag here and got a lot of results and one of them was:
 

The flag: dctf{th3_d13_h4s_b33n_c4st}

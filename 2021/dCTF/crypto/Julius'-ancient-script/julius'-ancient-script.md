## Challenge Description

>I found this Ancient Roman papyrus. Could you decypher it for me?

## Analysis
So the text that was given to us was this: rq7t{7vH_rFH_vI6_pHH1_qI67}.

I tried a few decoders such as cyberchef, cryptii and some unpopular sites as well but none of them seemed to work.

Then after going through more random unpopular sites I found one site which gave me good result https://planetcalc.com/8572/.

I entered the encrypted flag here and got a lot of results and one of them was:

![decrypted](https://github.com/thirty2/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/2021/dCTF/crypto/Julius'-ancient-script/julius_rot_ancient_script.png)

The flag: dctf{th3_d13_h4s_b33n_c4st}

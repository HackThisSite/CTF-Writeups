## Analysis
This was really simple and didnâ€™t took me any time at all.

I straight away went to the website and opened up the inspect element, I noticed this value was set to 0 which usually means no in human language

So I changed it 1 and checked the checkbox

Then I just clicked on Submit, and received the flag.

The flag: dctf{w3b_c4n_b3_fun_r1ght?}
